"World Footprint does not exactly match the sum of all countries for the following reasons: 
1. The built up land footprint uses different sources for some specific countries 2. The total does not include all countries. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Country grouping results are for included countries only,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Unless otherwise noted, all data from Global Footprint Network, National Footprint Accounts 2016 Edition. For more information visit: www.footprintnetwork.org/atlas",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regional totals are based on groupings defined by UNStats. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Number of Earths Required: This represents the number of planet Earths that would be required if everyone in the world lived the average lifestyle of a resident in this country.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Number of Countries Required: This represents how many times the country's biocapacity is needed in order to provide for the country's consumption Footprint.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note that these numbers assume people use biocapacity fully. However, wild species also require biologically productive space. When subtracting a portion of biocapacity for wild species, the ratios get larger.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
